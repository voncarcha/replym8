# Cursor Rules for ReplyM8 Project

## General Project Setup

- Always use Next.js App Router with TypeScript.
- Use TailwindCSS for styling.
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible instead of custom ones.
- Follow clean folder structure under src/: app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, utils/, types/.
- Use absolute imports via @/ alias.
- Enable dark mode using class strategy in Tailwind.

## Component Conversion Rules (HTML → JSX)

- When the user provides HTML + Tailwind code, convert it into React Server Components unless interactivity is needed.
- Always convert `class` to `className`.
- Refactor repeated UI blocks into reusable React components.
- Use functional components with named exports.
- Extract shared components like Navbar, Footer, Hero, Card, Button, Badge, etc.
- Utilize shadcn/ui components for buttons, cards, dialogs, dropdowns, forms, inputs, alerts.

## Component Architecture

- Place UI primitives (from shadcn) in src/components/ui/.
- Place custom components in src/components/shared/.
- Group route-specific components inside app/(segment)/components/.
- Put non-component logic in lib/ or utils/.
- Never put business logic inside React components unless simple.

## Next.js App Router Rules

- Use layout.tsx and page.tsx in every route.
- Use metadata export for SEO in each layout or page.
- Place global providers in src/app/providers.tsx and import them in root layout.
- Use Next.js Image and Link components where applicable.

## State Management

- Use React state sparingly; prefer server components unless client-side interactivity is needed.
- For shared state, use Zustand.
- For data fetching, use React Query or server actions when appropriate.

## File Naming and Code Style

- Use PascalCase for components.
- Use camelCase for utilities and functions.
- Name hooks with `use` prefix.
- Do not leave dead code, console.logs, or unused imports.
- Type everything with TypeScript.
- Prefer async/await over .then().

## Tailwind Standards

- Use Tailwind for layout and spacing.
- Avoid long utility chains by using componentized class merging utilities when needed.
- Use `cn()` helper for conditional classes.
- Use container classes for consistent layout.

## UI/UX Quality Rules

- Ensure mobile responsiveness first.
- Use consistent spacing: multiples of 2 or 4.
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
- Use appropriate aria attributes for accessibility.
- Use shadcn modal/dialog/dropdown components for interactivity.

## When generating pages

- Always include <Metadata> export.
- Wrap content in a responsive container class.
- Use a consistent page heading structure (h1, h2, h3).

## Code Comments & Cleanliness

- Add comments only when necessary.
- Do not generate overly verbose comments.
- Explain complex logic inside comments when needed.

## Final Output Rules

- Always generate fully functional, runnable code.
- Follow conventions across the entire project.
- If user provides unclear instructions, ask clarifying questions.
- Never invent APIs or features unless explicitly requested.
- Ensure all generated components compile without errors.
