# Project Setup

## Technology Stack

- Always use Next.js 16 App Router with TypeScript (strict mode enabled).
- Use TailwindCSS v4 for styling with custom HSL color system.
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible instead of custom ones.
- Follow clean folder structure under src/: app/, components/, lib/, hooks/, utils/, types/.
- Use absolute imports via @/ alias (configured in tsconfig.json).
- Enable dark mode using class strategy in Tailwind (`darkMode: ["class"]`).
- Use Clerk for authentication with server-side auth checks.
- Use Supabase for database with SSR support via @supabase/ssr.

## General Principles

- Always generate fully functional, runnable code.
- Follow conventions across the entire project consistently.
- If user provides unclear instructions, ask clarifying questions.
- Never invent APIs or features unless explicitly requested.
- Ensure all generated components compile without TypeScript errors.
- Use existing patterns from the codebase as reference.
- Match the existing code style and formatting.
