# Component Architecture

## Component Organization

- Place UI primitives (from shadcn) in `src/components/ui/`.
- Place custom shared components in `src/components/shared/`.
- Place auth-related components in `src/components/auth/`.
- Group route-specific components inside `app/(segment)/components/` if needed.
- Put non-component logic in `lib/` or `utils/`.
- Never put business logic inside React components unless simple.
- Use Server Components by default; add `"use client"` only when needed (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs).

## Component Conversion Rules (HTML → JSX)

- When the user provides HTML + Tailwind code, convert it into React Server Components unless interactivity is needed.
- Always convert `class` to `className`.
- Refactor repeated UI blocks into reusable React components.
- Use functional components with named exports (e.g., `export function ComponentName`).
- Extract shared components like Navbar, Footer, Hero, Card, Button, Badge, etc.
- Utilize shadcn/ui components for buttons, cards, dialogs, dropdowns, forms, inputs, alerts, drawers.

## Component Patterns

- Use shadcn Drawer component for slide-out panels (e.g., right-side drawers).
- Use shadcn Card components for content containers.
- Use shadcn Button with variants: `default`, `outline`, `ghost`, `destructive`, `secondary`, `link`.
- Use lucide-react icons consistently throughout the app.
- Use `Link` from `next/link` for internal navigation.
- Use `usePathname()` from `next/navigation` for active route detection.
- Use conditional rendering with `cn()` for active/inactive states.
