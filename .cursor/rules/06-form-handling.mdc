# Form Handling

## React Hook Form & Zod

- Use React Hook Form (`useForm`) with Zod (`zodResolver`) for form validation.
- Define Zod schemas before component definition.
- Use shadcn Form components (`Form`, `FormField`, `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormMessage`, `FormDescription`).
- Use `z.infer<typeof schema>` for TypeScript types from Zod schemas.
- Handle form submission with async functions and proper error handling.
- Reset forms after successful submission.
